# Carpet
Carpet is a super simple Sass structure for new sites. I decided to give it a name and substance, so that I will build my next sites using a "solid foundation" that I would work on and update as a separate project.

Hopefully, you will find it as useful as I do. Suggestions are more than welcome.

1. Read about [structuring a Sass project]("http://thesassway.com/beginner/how-to-structure-a-sass-project").
2. Download Carpet.
3. Use Carpet.
